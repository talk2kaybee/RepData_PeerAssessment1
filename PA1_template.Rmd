## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
detach("package:plyr", unload=TRUE)
library(dplyr)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity <- tbl_df(activity)
by_date = group_by(activity, date)
steps_per_day = summarize(by_date, totalSteps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
steps_per_day
```
## Histogram

```{r}
hist(steps_per_day$totalSteps)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r}
summarise(steps_per_day, mean = mean(totalSteps), median = median(totalSteps))
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
